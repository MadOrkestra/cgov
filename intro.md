# What this tool wants to do
- Provide a way for all ADA holders to submit their feedback, ideas and objections to the draft constitution by Intersect and share it with their Delegate for the Constitutional Convention.
- Provide a way for Delegates to collect and organize the ideas and objections for the Constitutional Convention
- Get a better and transparent understanding where the Cardano Community is in the process of agreeing on a Constitution to be put on chain to be ratified by their dReps.
- Prepare for what comes next and document things in the process.

# What this tool doesn't do
- Provide a platform for extensive discussions. There are better formats for this such as X spaces, in person meetings or video calls.

# How to use this tool
- Connect your Wallet (you don't have to if you just want to read, but we obviously need active participation in the process)
- Choose your Delegate on your profile
- Navigate to the section of the Intersect draft you want to read or submit feedback on.
- Use the comment function to make your voice heard or like comments that have already been made
- Up or downvote paragraphs, so the Community and their Delegates can get an overall feel on which sections and paragraphs need to be most discussed

# What else
- Please inform your Delegate and the Cardano community this exists now. The Constitution is Cardanos most important document so far - every effort to get it as right as possible has to be made.
- We are fully aware and thankful there are other draft versions out there. This tools focusses on the Constitutional Convention for now while we are putting the wheels on a car that is already moving.
- Please note that this tool is a last minute, no-budget Community effort, bugs may occur. We will push more features like stats, resources and other things as quickly as possible.
- Play nice, this is Cardano.
